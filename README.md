# String-Similarity-LevenshteinX
I researched string similarity methods, focusing on Levenshtein distance and its variants. I explored their mathematical foundations, analyzed various sources, and implemented Levenshtein-X (EDIT) for better efficiency in fuzzy matching and text analysis. My study compares its performance, identifies limitations, and suggests improvements.
